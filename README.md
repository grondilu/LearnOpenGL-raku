This is a fork of the [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com) code repository.  See [parent repo](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL) for details.

This fork contains Raku code (using NativeCall libraries in ./lib) attempting to replicate the tutorials.

# Status

I'm lazy so I did the bare minimum, so the tasks below may be marked as
completed even though the exercises are not.

- [x] getting started
- [ ] lighting
- [ ] model loading
- [ ] advanced opengl
- [ ] advanced lighting
- [ ] pbr
- [ ] in practice


# Dependencies

Lots of: OpenGL, GLFW, SOIL ...   You need to install these libraries on your system,
likely along with their development versions (`-devel`).  I will eventually write
more details for at least Fedora and Debian.
